***



###### 1 
Yahweh reigns! He is clothed with majesty! Yahweh is armed with strength. The world also is established. It can't be moved. 

###### 2 
Your throne is established from long ago. You are from everlasting. 

###### 3 
The floods have lifted up, Yahweh, the floods have lifted up their voice. The floods lift up their waves. 

###### 4 
Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, Yahweh on high is mighty. 

###### 5 
Your statutes stand firm. Holiness adorns your house, Yahweh, forever more.
