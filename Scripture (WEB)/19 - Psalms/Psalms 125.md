###### 1 
Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion, which can't be moved, but remains forever. 

###### 2 
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more. 

###### 3 
For the scepter of wickedness won't remain over the allotment of the righteous; so that the righteous won't use their hands to do evil. 

###### 4 
Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, to those who are upright in their hearts. 

###### 5 
But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways, Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be on Israel.
