###### 1 
Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh. 

###### 2 
Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions. 

###### 3 
If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? 

###### 4 
But there is forgiveness with you, therefore you are feared. 

###### 5 
I wait for Yahweh. My soul waits. I hope in his word. 

###### 6 
My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning. 

###### 7 
Israel, hope in Yahweh, for there is loving kindness with Yahweh. Abundant redemption is with him. 

###### 8 
He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
