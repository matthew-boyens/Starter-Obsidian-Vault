###### 1 
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 

###### 2 
"Dominion and fear are with him. He makes peace in his high places. 

###### 3 
Can his armies be counted? On whom does his light not arise? 

###### 4 
How then can man be just with God? Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean? 

###### 5 
Behold, even the moon has no brightness, and the stars are not pure in his sight; 

###### 6 
How much less man, who is a worm, the son of man, who is a worm!"
