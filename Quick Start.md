# Creating a new note

Creating a new note can be done **from the side bar** or **making a link and then clicking on it**. 


## Creating a new note from the side bar
Once a new note has been created, you'll need to ==give it a title== and then ==insert the template==

![[Screen Shot 2022-01-08 at 4.49.36 pm.png]]
1. Click on create note in new pane icon (note you can return to this page by scrolling to the left or by reopening it via method above if it gets closed)

2. Give your note a title. I'll call this 'My New note' for example, but in practice you would call this something more specific to your intended content. Note the titles of our currently open notes (Quick Start and My new note) are vertically stacked a bit like a books on a bookshelf. This allows are to quickly jump between our open notes without skipping a beat. More on this later.

3. Next you want to add in some standard fields to enable you to keep track of the status of the file, what it is related to, any aliases you might have (we'll go into this later) and the time the file was created. You don't need to do this of course, but it does help doing this extra step when it comes to searching/reviewing files later.  Instead of doing this manually each time we'll insert a template that does this for us. This is done by clicking on the 'Templater' icon while our new note is in focus (if it is not in focus, click on the title and it will be).

4.  This will open a dialog box that gives you a list of templates you can use. You can build your own templates, but we'll just use the base template for now. Click on 'New Note Template'

5. This will insert the [[Standardised Fields]] with todays date, your title and put the cursor down ready to type. Win! Note the same title that is vertical on the 'spine' is also now horizontal in the document. These aren't synced (so if you update one you'll have to update the other), however this allows you to get the best of both worlds - vertical titles to see what notes you have open and horizontal titles for ease of reading. 
7.  We will cover how to use these fields later, however feel free to hover over the [[Standardised Fields]] link to get a seek peak of the contents.



## Formatting your notes 

By adding these symbols before, obsidian will markup the document with some simple formatting

| Symbol                 | Description                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| -                      | Creates a bullet point                              |
| #                      | Header 1                                            |
| ##                     | Header 2                                            |
| ###                    | Header 3 and so on                                  |
| == Text goes here \==] | Put == on each side of the text (ignore \)          |
| ** Text goes here \**  | Same as highlighting but for bold                   |
| * Text goes here *     | Italics                                             |
| ---                    | 3 dashes form a divider so you can separate content |
| >                      | Marks paragraph as a quote in the document          |               |                                                     |
